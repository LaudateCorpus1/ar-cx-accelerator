    <p>Interact with the 3D model using the following gestures. Not all gestures may be used at the same time.</p>
    <p class="header">Single-Finger Tap (Short)</p>
    <p>Tap on a specific UI element with one finger to select a part of the 3D model. Use to select a node of the 3D model, which will change the
        information on the screen relative to what was selected.</p>
    <p class="header">Single-Finger Tap (Long / Press and Hold)</p>
    <p>Tap on a specific UI element with one finger to select and drag a part of the 3D model away from its current position. This is helpful to explore
        model parts that are close together. Use the two-finger tap gesture (below) to reset moved parts to their
        original position.</p>
    <p class="header">Two-Finger Tap</p>
    <p>Tap anywhere on the screen with two fingers to select the full model. Use this to re-select the model to scale, rotate, and reposition it.</p>
    <p class="header">Three-Finger Tap</p>
    <p>Tap anywhere on the screen with three fingers to run an action for the model. This can vary based on the model, but typically involves animating the inner
        components of the model. The first tap will start the action and the next will return the items to their
        original state.</p>
    <p class="header">Two-Finger Pinch</p>
    <p>Changes the size of the model. Pinch out to make it larger and pinch in to make it smaller.</p>
    <p class="header">Two-Finger Rotate</p>
    <p>Rotates the part of the 3D model that is currently selected. Use the two-finger tap gesture first, then rotate,
        if you want to move the whole model.</p>
    <p class="header">Two-Finger Pan</p>
    <p>Drag two fingers across the screen to move the full model along the x and y axis.</p>
    <p class="header">Three-Finger Pan</p>
    <p>Drag three fingers up or down on the screen to change the opacity of the digital twin.</p>
